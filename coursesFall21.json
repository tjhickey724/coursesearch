Decision making often suffers when situations include uncertainty, dynamically complex problems, high stakes, and time and performance pressures. We will look for connections between how people make decisions and the organizational outcomes we experience. The course will include a mix of some basic tools, such as linear programming and causal loop diagramming, and some more macro level reflection on decision processes in health care environments. To assist this reflection, the course introduces the tools of systems thinking for modeling and analyzing organizational policy and strategy.

Sex Sells! It\u2019s the immortal truism of the advertising industry. But how does sex sell? For decades, advertisers have used hot bods and innuendo to suggest that power and pleasure can be bought. In the 1970s, the battle cry, \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, Baby!\u201d pushed cigarettes as the hip accessories of feminism and the sexual revolution. Today, brands blend consumerism with gender activism, invite LGBTQ to the mainstream marketplace, and tempt millennials with new promises of sex and success. In this course, students find and write about advertising that delights, infuriates, and perplexes them. In the first essay, they dissect their choice of pornographic food commercials, Budweiser bromances, and Calvin Klein billboards that titillate consumers and reshape social constructs of masculinity and femininity.

In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim\u2019s DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer \u2013 a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science.  We will investigate the work of forensic anthropologists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as Bones, CSI, or Crossing Jordan.

The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies?

Yet infrastructures are often hidden, subterranean, and therefore prone to exploitation and hijacking. The anthropology of infrastructure aims in part at making it more visible and at deciphering the complex interaction between things, society, and politics. But anthropologists end up unearthing more than utility networks and urbanism plans.

Public schools pride themselves as neutral playing fields when it comes to matters of religion. But this position belies a more complicated history.

Indeed, despite lip service to ideas like separation of Church and state, American educational leaders long saw schools as a vehicle for promoting a Protestant inflected American culture. This course begins from the premise that American education and American religion have always existed in relationship. Religious groups have sometimes tried to use the public schools as vehicles to advance their religion, sometimes, they have created supplemental schools, and sometimes they have created whole parallel school systems. But in all cases, education and religion in American are intertwined. This course asks when education is religious and when religion is educational.

But while we might proudly wear the jersey of our favorite team or post selfies from the crowd of a music festival, we enjoy some of our pop-cultural favorites in secret as though they were \"guilty pleasures.\" But what makes a pleasure guilty? How does shame play into our consumption of culture? Why are we embarrassed about the things we love?

The focus of this course will be on both integration of religious identity factors into conflict analysis and an introduction to faith-based interventions skills, used by religious actors to foster coexistence. During the course, we will explore different types of contemporary conflict in which religion functions as a conflict driver, including how to understand and handle conflicts perpetrated by extremist religious groups.

The purpose of these assignments, and the course in general, is to provide students the opportunity to assess concrete conflict situations in which religious identity is a factor, know the potential contribution that faith-based actors can make to coexistence, and evaluate how best to function in faith-based peacebuilding roles and reconciliation processes that interest them.

The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today's research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway & Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial & yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project. Currently we are massing useable data from past classes for publication purposes. This class has a large time commitment both during and outside of class time and should not be taken in conjunction with other research laboratories or internships.

We will share examples of Presidential satire leading up to the November election. And we will discuss the following questions: Can political satire produce social change?

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Joey and Chandler, Woody and Buzz, Thelma and Louise, Hermoine and Harry: over the years, television and movies have provided numerous definitions of \u201cfriendship\u201d through various depictions of \u201cbesties\u201d and \u201cbosom-buddies.\u201d These definitions naturally reflect the changing societal values and cultural norms from which they emerge. The same can be said for depictions about friendship from the ancient world. The relationships between Ruth and Naomi, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, David and Jonathan, or Achilles and Patroclus can provide rich insight into the boundaries of friendship that still hold true today. In this course, we will consider numerous depictions of friendship and consider what assumptions they convey in their time and place. Through reading a novel or short story from popular culture or the ancient world, watching a television episode of Friends or Black Mirror, or critically examining a movie like Toy Story or Clueless, we will seek answers to questions like: What are the benefits of friendship? What role does gender play in friendship? What do friendship-depictions tell us about how audiences view and participate in friendship? Our understanding will be facilitated through modern studies of friendship from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Through engagement with primary source material in combination with class discussions, we will learn analytic and writing skills that will enable us to think critically about what it means to be a friend.

In 2009, a woman was found murdered in rural Louisiana. There were no witnesses, but seeming evidence led police to suspect undocumented immigrants. The victim\u2019s DNA, however, did not match any of the Mexican suspects. Years later a new forensic technology generated a portrait of the killer \u2013 a blonde male of Northern European ancestry, and an arrest was made. Forensic science has not only helped to identify the dead, to solve crimes, and to bring culprits to justice. Forensic techniques, accepted at the time but later discredited, have also led to false convictions, as in the case of a man found guilty of rape who spent decades in prison before DNA tests confirmed his innocence, or in the case of an arsonist who was exonerated by the State of Texas in 2011 but had been executed years earlier. This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science.  We will investigate the work of forensic anthropologists, take a look at real-life cases to learn about the history and effectiveness of investigative techniques, and analyze how forensic science has been portrayed (and transformed) in popular television series such as Bones, CSI, or Crossing Jordan.

Today, international adoption is a normalized and accepted institution that helps to express dominant US ideologies of humanitarianism, internationalism, and multiculturalism. But American\u2019s sudden and unprecedented desire to adopt children from abroad was anything but natural, informed instead by the dynamic geopolitical imperatives of the early Cold War years. Since then, the knowledge production around international adoption in the United States has been dominated by American social workers and adoptive parents. This 2-credit hour practicum interrogates the knowledge production about international adoption that has historically privileged perspectives from the receiving country or that of adoptive parents in particular. Instead we investigate the cultural, ethnic, and racial experiences of transnationally, transracially adopted individuals as well as their birth families long overlooked in adoption studies.

However, when comparing humans with the rest of the animal world, are we really so different? In this course, we will examine through discussion and writing the degree to which human morality is grounded in our evolutionary past. We will explore the development of human morality during childhood and adulthood through the lens of evolution and will look at classic scientific tests of morality/ethics (e.g., the trolley problem). Additionally, we will engage with evidence for morality in non-human species and probe the degree to which our primate relatives engage in altruistic, empathetic, and moral behaviors.

The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today's research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway & Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial & yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project. Currently we are massing useable data from past classes for publication purposes. This class has a large time commitment both during and outside of class time and should not be taken in conjunction with other research laboratories or internships.

When we think of the American West, we might envision images of cowboys and Indians, of danger and folk heroes. But these images mask a darker side of struggles and colonization; some even argue that Westward expansion in the 19th Century lay the roots for American expansionist policies in the Cold War era and beyond. This course will interrogate these seemingly conflicting narratives. We will first watch the classic John Ford western film, Stagecoach, in which the mysterious cowboy/outlaw character, Ringo Kid, helps to protect a group of innocent pioneer townsfolk on a dangerous stagecoach trip across the American Southwest. For the research essay, students select a topic and text of their choice, ranging from the film Pocahantas, to a painting by Georgia O\u2019Keefe, to a classic novel by John Steinbeck, in order to explore the idealization of the American West and the lingering effects of that idealization today.

This course explores the history of that relationship through various perspectives, geographies, terrains, and political traditions developing a conceptual understanding of our evolving relationship to the earth we inhabit. We will look at technology, agriculture, urban planning, forestry, and social movements as lenses through which to interpret that relationship. To do this, the course uses sources from history, film, literature, and political science to paint a broad picture of how humans have experienced the natural world and made sense of and/or resisted that experience.
